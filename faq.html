                      The success of engaging smart-city applications in moving society toward effective, resilient communities involves dynamic collaboration between city and municipal government, technology companies, app developers, and engaged citizens.

The greatest successes are realized where local constituents can engage these tools to access information but also have input in the planning and design process. Designers and consultants must collaborate with city leaders, planners, and tech industry partners to help plan a smart community that provides equity across housing, mobility, infrastructure, public realm, and shared services. And members of the communities most in need of infrastructure and quality-of-life upgrades must have the opportunity to voice opinions on the smart technology their city needs.      </div>

                      Does it serve the goals of the broader community? Is it scalable to improve the quality of life beyond a narrow target audience?

As an example, will shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) programs be located to improve personal mobility choices for low-income communities or only target business districts? Will SAVs disincentivize the upgrade of existing public transit services to outlying communities? Are we identifying our most chronic urban problems and developing technology to address themâ€”or are we developing technology and then finding problems with which to justify it?

We must extend the benefits of the smart city out to those communities least likely to have the budget for smart street lights, smart bus stops, smart homes, smart air sensors, and personal health trackers.                  </div>

                      The concept of sustainability in a smart city refers to using intelligent planning and management to conserve the natural environment, manage natural resources prudently, and save on energy costs. Sustainability is a critical principle because of the challenges posed by rapid urbanization. According to the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), 66% of the global population will be residing in urban areas. This will put tremendous pressure on existing infrastructure, natural resources, and drive-up energy needs, hence the need for sustainable management. Smart cities leverage technology to solve these problems.

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                      The four pillars of a smart city are insights drawn from the developmental roadmap of leading smart cities from around the world. They include:

Network connectivity: an IoT-enabled infrastructure with a robust network of devices and connected applications.
Effective mobility: this could be achieved in several ways, such as through intelligent transport systems, shared mobility, mobility as a service, and so on.
Cyber resilience: the ability to strike a delicate balance between efficiency and data privacy.
City engagement: Involvement by citizens in smart city initiatives.

                      Are Smart Cities worth it?

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                      To the extent that smart cities can solve contemporary urban problems, they are worth the investment. However, smart does not automatically mean better, more livable, or more secure. For example, living in a smart city might curtail our privacy and potentially threaten democratic core values such as freedom,

liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The reason is that technology has consequences such as loss of privacy, hackers, and techno-terrorist attacks. In smart cities, the already wide divide between rural and urban populations, culture, and politics has the potential to become wider with dangerous implications. Human beings must work hard to make our cities places where we would want to live and raise our families. Technology is not a panacea. It provides an improvement in the quality of life only with proper planning and clear thinking.

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                      Smart cities rely on connected devices and sensors. Devices include smartphones and other Internet-enabled mobile gadgets, electronic devices, vehicles, connected home appliances, and just about any device with an Internet connection. Sensors are installed in various places around the city to collect data such as foot and vehicle traffic, weather information, crime incidents, energy consumption, other utility usages, and much more data. This data is analyzed in real-time by city officials and citizens to make decisions such as traffic routes and security deployments. Historical data reveals trends that inform infrastructure planning decisions and resource management.
